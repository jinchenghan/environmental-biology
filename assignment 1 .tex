\section{First Assignment }

Each student will prepare independently a list of what he/she thinks the  five most important research questions in environmental microbiology.

\section {The List of The Most Important Research Question}
2.1 Is it possible to use artificial intelligence (AI) to stimulate and track the process of microbiology? \\
\\
'Full laboratory automation in Microbiology is having an impact on laboratories today. It is well established that, despite technical differences in hardware, full microbiology laboratory automation systems available in the market share similar components: specimen processing, track, image acquisitions systems, smart incubation, and workstations. The key difference in the systems revolves around the strength and technology behind algorithms and the extent of use of AI.' (site by  Gabriela France, 2017) \\
\\
2.2 What are the applications of environmental microbiology?\\
For example,use environmental microbiology  knowledge to wastewater treatment.\\
\\
2.3 Environmental microbiology and health concern; climate and food safety.\\
\\
2.4 What is the function of single species for microbial communities?\\
\\
2.5 What the mainly mechanisms of anaerobic/aerobic degradation process?\\
